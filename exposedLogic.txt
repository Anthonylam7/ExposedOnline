This makes the game work without taget abilities for now.

PreWork: Create an init file for card information. This could be JSON and XML
Specify each card in JSON/XML if the card is restricted to a game player number mode

Every object is accessed by reference (naturally in Java). So if a card property is
changed in a List, then it will be reflected on all lists that also contain that reference.

Modes: 2 (4x4, 2 targets), 3-4 (5x5, 3 targets), 5-6 (6x6, 4 targets) players
Ex:
	<card>
		<mode>2</mode>
		<name>x</name>
		<descr>y</descr>
	</card>

Card {
	string name
	string description
	bool target
	bool exposed
	int xLoc
	int yLoc
	int wallets
	
	init(name, descr) {
		initialize name and descr
	}
}

Player {
	int wallets
	Card card
	
	init(card) {
		initialize card
	}
	
	
}



Game {
	Queue<Card> deck
	List<Player> players
	List<Card> cardsOnGrid
	List<Card> targetCards
	int boardHeigth
	int boardWidth
	
	init() {
		- Initialize varialbes
		- Ask for number of players. Based on this, intialize board dimmensions (read rules for specifications on this)
		- Go through init file. For each XML/JSON high level taget
			- if mode corresponds to current game mode
				- Create card with name and descr
				- Add to deck
		- Shuffle deck 
		- Create players (based on number asked) and give them each the next card on deck (actually poll from deck)
		- Assign local xLoc and yLoc to 0. This is for coordinate (0,0)
		- For each card in deck (without polling from deck)
			- Assign local xLoc and yLoc to card xLoc and yLoc
			- Assign card's wallet to the initial number of wallet (number of wallets based on whether its corner card or not)
			- Add card to cardsOnGrid
			- Carefully increment local xLoc and yLoc such that it stays within the board dimmensions
		- Shuffle deck again
		- Poll numTarget (based on game mode) from deck, modify the card's var to true, add card to targetCards list
	}
	
	gameloop() {
		- Check if there is a winner. Function.
		- Ask player for action
