<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is a free, non-profit fan-made game of the popular

Welcome to <strong>Exposed Online</strong>, a fan made version of the popular board game
<strong>Exposed!</strong>. In this game, you play as a pickpocket who has infiltrated a
party disguised as a guess. You objective is swipe as many valuables as you can hold. 
Unlucky for you, other pickpockets have also made it into the party. You must employ the 
art of deception to avoid being caught as you pilfer from unsuspecting party guesses.
Of course, eliminating your competition by exposing them along way will make you job much
easier.

## How to Play
<strong>Objective:</strong> Your goal is to either collect seven valuables or be the 
only pickpocket not exposed.

### The game:
The game consists of a 4-by-4, 5-by-5, or 6-by-6 tile grid depending on the total number
of players. Each spot in the grid represents a guest attending the party. Each guess starts
with with at least 1 valuable on them while guests at the corner have 2 valuables. 

At the beginning of the game, players are assigned roles among those in the grid. The
identity of each player is hidden to the other players.
<br>Each player takes turn performing 1 of 4 actions each turn: Move, Steal, Expose, and
Snitch. <br>(More on this later)<br>
<br>Also at the party are marked targets. Whenever a player steal from these targets the
ability of the target is activated giving the player a unique advantage. If any of the
targets have zero valuables they are immediately exposed and a new target is assigned.


### Actions:
Players are able to choose among 1 of 4 actions to take each turn: Move, Steal, Expose, 
and snitch.

<strong>Move:</strong> If chosen, the player must take this action twice. Choose two
guests that are directly adjacent to each other and swap their position.

<strong>Steal:</strong> Choose any guests surrounding your pickpocket and take 1 of their
valuables. If you are unexposed then valuable goes to your secret stash, otherwise, the
valuable will be added to your exposed pickpocket. If the guess was a marked target, 
their ability is activated as well.

<strong>Expose:</strong> Choose any guest that is on the same row or column as your 
pickpocket and expose them. Exposed guests are marked with a red background. If the
exposed guest is another player then half of their stash will be confiscated and the
remaining will be added to their pickpocket.

<strong>Snitch:</strong> If you are unexposed and there exists another unexposed player
you may "reveal" your identity to that player and gain the ability to expose any spot
on the grid. Note: Revealing does not mean you are exposed.
